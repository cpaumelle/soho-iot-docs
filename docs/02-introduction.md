# Introduction

## Purpose
Provide a robust, scalable IoT platform for data ingestion, device management, and visualization, suitable for SOHO and SME environments.

## Scope
Covers server-side components: ingestion gateway, device management API, reverse proxy, database admin, and frontend integration.

## Background
This platform evolved from initial proofs-of-concept to a containerized, microservice architecture optimized for rapid deployment and maintainability.

## High-Level Requirements
- **Functional**:  
  - Ingest raw uplink data via HTTP.  
  - CRUD operations on device metadata.  
  - Reverse‚Äêproxy routing and TLS termination.  
  - Database admin interface.  
- **Non-Functional**:  
  - 99.9% uptime.  
  - Scalable to thousands of devices.  
  - Secure defaults (TLS, authentication).  
  - Automated backups and monitoring.
